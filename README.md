### Description
This node.js library can merge multiple PDF documents, or parts of them, to one new PDF document. It's only dependency is pdf-lib so it can run in any javascript-only environnement without any external dependencies.

If you are searching for the legacy version based on pdfjs please install a v3 release. Since v4 we use pdf-lib instead.

This library is inspired by the PHP library PDFMerger and has a very similar API.
